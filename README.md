# kavita-sync

This is a very rough proof of concept for syncing to [Kavita](https://www.kavitareader.com/) via a [NickelMenu](https://pgaskin.net/NickelMenu/) shortcut on a Kobo ereader. This is will download books based on specific queries from Kavita reader and put them on identically named shelves on the Kobo reader.

## TODO:
- Fix timeout issue in NickelMenu command
- Improve documentation for query
- Improve setup documentation
- Add support for query by genre/author/etc name, rather than internal Kavita ID
- Add support for progress syncing
